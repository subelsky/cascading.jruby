0.0.8 - AggregateBy and upgrade to Cascading 2.0.0 wip-286

This release upgrades to Cascading 2.0.0 wip-286, but again does not implement
local mode.  It does, however, replace group_by/union which contain only count,
sum, and average with the corresponding composite AggregateBy.  Various
refactorings were required to support this, including the addition of limited
support for SubAssemblies.

0.0.7 - Upgrade to Cascading 2.0.0 wip-255

This release upgrades to Cascading 2.0.0 wip-255, but implements neither local
mode nor aggregations through AggregateBy.  Local jobs continue to run in Hadoop
mode, but we intend to release local mode support soon.

0.0.6 - Removing primary key

The primary key feature was a source of great confusion at Etsy, so it's been
removed.  This release also closes several issues, warns about potential node
name conflicts, and updates the tests to work under JRuby 1.6.5.

0.0.5 - Addressing Janino pain

This release expands upon the ExprStub class adding composition time compilation
and validation of Janino expressions.  This causes faulty Janino expressions to
fail early rather than hours into a job.

0.0.4 - Cleanup

This release merges in a good deal of work from Etsy and addresses many internal
structural issues with cascading.jruby node hierarchies.  Greatly expands unit
tests and makes samples easily executable as a form of functional testing.

0.0.3 - Etsy's first version of cascading.jruby

First major commit of work from Etsy that introduces scope propagation to
cascading.jruby scripts in support of field propagation and primary keys.
Mainly a cleanup and testing release.
