module Cascading
  # Allows you to plugin c.p.SubAssemblies to a cascading.jruby Assembly.
  #
  # Assumptions:
  # * You will either use the tail_pipe of the calling Assembly, or overwrite
  # its incoming_scopes (as do join and union)
  # * Your subassembly will have only 1 tail pipe; branching is not
  # supported.  This allows you to continue operating upon the tail of the
  # SubAssembly within the calling Assembly
  # * You will not use nested c.p.SubAssemblies
  #
  # This is a low-level tool, so be careful.
